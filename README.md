# Bayesian neural networks
An implementation of Bayesian neural networks using Variational Inference, Monte Carlo Dropout, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with training on two toy datasets.

To run, use:
`python main.py --dataset=[D]`
where D is either 'circles' or 'moons'. The program saves one figure for each method, each figure showing the predictive distribution of each point in the domain.
